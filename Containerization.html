                <p class="lead"> Containerization is a type of Virtualization which brings
                    virtualization to the operating system level. While Virtualization brings abstraction
                    to the hardware,
                    Containerization brings abstraction to the operating system.</p>

                <p><h4>  Reasons to use Containers-</h4>
                Benefits of Using Containers:
                <ul>

                    <li> Containers have no guest OS and use the host’s operating system.
                        So, they share relevant libraries & resources as and when needed.</li>
                    <li>Processing and execution of applications are very fast since applications
                        specific binaries and libraries of containers run on the host kernel.</li>
                    <li>Booting up a container takes only a fraction of a second, and also containers are
                        lightweight and faster than Virtual Machines. </li> </ul> </p>

                <p><h4>  What is Docker? </h4>
                Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
                Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you
                can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in
                the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of
                Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly,
                you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.</p>
                <p><h4> Benefits of Docker-</h4>
                <ul> <li> Fast, consistent delivery of your applications
                    Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in
                    standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services.
                    Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.</li>
                    <li>Responsive deployment and scaling </li>
                    Docker’s container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer’s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
                    Docker’s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time.
                    <li> Running more workloads on the same hardware </li>
                    Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based
                    virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals.
                    Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments
                    where you need to do more with fewer resources. </li> </ul> </p>
                <p><h4> Docker architecture-</h4>

                </div>
                Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon,
                which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
                The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect
                a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate
                using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is
                Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.</p>
                <p> <h4>
                The Docker daemon </h4>
                The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages
                Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
                A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.</p>
                <p><h4> The Docker client </h4>
                The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker.
                When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd,
                which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker
                client can communicate with more than one daemon.</p>
                <p> <h4> Docker registries </h4>
                A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.
                When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, the required
                images are pulled from your configured registry.
                When you use the docker push command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.</p>
                <p><h4> Dockerfile, Images & Containers </h4>

                When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins,
                and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.<ul>

                <li> Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text document which contains all the commands
                    that a user can call on the command line to assemble an image.
                    So, Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
                    You can use docker build to create an automated build to execute several command-line
                    instructions in succession.</li>
                <li>Docker Image: In layman terms, Docker Image
                    can be compared to a template which is used to create
                    Docker Containers. So, these read-only templates are the
                    building blocks of a Container. You can use docker run to run the image and create a container.</li>
                <li>Docker Images are stored in the Docker Registry. It can be either a user’s
                    local repository or a public repository like a Docker Hub which allows multiple users
                    to collaborate in building an application.</li>
                <li>Docker Container: It is a running instance of a Docker Image as
                    they hold the entire package needed to run the application. So,
                    these are basically the ready applications created from Docker Images
                    which is the ultimate utility of Docker.</li></ul>
