            <p class="lead"> Virtualization is a process that allows for more efficient utilization of physical
                computer hardware and is the foundation of cloud computing</p>

                <p><h4>How Virtualization works?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtualization 101
Due to the limitations of x86 servers, many IT organizations must deploy multiple servers,
                    each operating at a fraction of their capacity, to keep pace with today’s
                    high storage and processing demands. The result: huge inefficiencies and
                    excessive operating costs.</li>


<li>Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system.
    This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and
    applications – on a single server. The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.</li>
            </ul> </p>
        <p>    <h4>Virtual Machines Explained</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A virtual computer system is known as a “virtual machine” (VM): a
        tightly isolated software container with an operating system and application inside.
        Each self-contained VM is completely independent. Putting multiple VMs on a single
        computer enables several operating systems and applications to run on just one physical
        server, or “host.”</li>

<li> A thin layer of software called a “hypervisor” decouples the virtual machines
    from the host and dynamically allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.</li> </ul> </p>

<p><h4>Key Properties of Virtual Machines-</h4>
            <p> VMs have the following characteristics, which offer several benefits- </p>

 <h4> Partitioning </h4><ul>
<li>	Run multiple operating systems on one physical machine.</li>
    <li>	Divide system resources between virtual machines.</li></ul>
 <h4>Isolation </h4> <ul>
            <li>	Provide fault and security isolation at the hardware level. </li>
            <li>	Preserve performance with advanced resource controls.</li></ul>
<h4> Encapsulation</h4><ul>
            <li>Save the entire state of a virtual machine to files. </li>
<li>Move and copy virtual machines as easily as moving and copying files.</li></ul>
 <h4>Hardware Independence </h4>
            <li>Provision or migrate any virtual machine to any physical server.</li> </p>
            <p><h4>Types of Virtualization-</h4>
 <p><h4>1. Server Virtualization </h4>

            <div class="col-md text-center mt-auto mb-4 ">
                 <img src="Images/Virt.2.png" class="col-md-7" alt="Responsive image">
            </div>


Server virtualization enables multiple operating systems to run on a single physical
    server as highly efficient virtual machines. Key benefits include: <ul>
<li>Greater IT efficiencies</li>
<li>Reduced operating costs</li>
<li>Faster workload deployment</li>
<li>Increased application performance</li>
<li>Higher server availability</li>
            <li>Eliminated server sprawl and complexity</li> </ul> </p>

<p> <h4>2. Network Virtualization </h4>
             <div class="col-md text-center mt-auto mb-4 ">
                 <img src="Images/Virt.3.png" class="col-md-7" alt="Responsive image">
            </div>

By completely reproducing a physical network, network virtualization
            allows applications to run on a virtual network as if
            they were running on a physical network — b
            ut with greater operational benefits and all the hardware
            independencies of virtualization.
            (Network virtualization presents
            logical networking devices and services —
            logical ports, switches, routers, firewalls,
            load balancers, VPNs and more — to connected workloads.) </p>

            <p> <h4>3. Desktop Virtualization </h4>

             <div class="col-md text-center mt-auto mb-4 ">
                 <img src="Images/Virt.4.png" class="col-md-7" alt="Responsive image">
            </div>
            Desktop virtualization allows the users’ OS to

            be remotely stored on a server in the data centre.

            It allows the user to access their desktop virtually,
            from any location by a different machine. Users
            who want specific operating systems other than
            Windows Server will need to have a virtual desktop.
            Main benefits of desktop virtualization are user mobility,
            portability, easy management of software installation, updates and patches.
        </p>

            <p><h4> Benefits of virtualization- </h4>
Virtualization brings several benefits to data center operators and service providers:
<ul>
    <li> Resource efficiency: Before virtualization, each application server required its own dedicated
        physical CPU—IT staff would purchase and configure a separate server for each application
        they wanted to run. (IT preferred one application and one operating system (OS) per computer
        for reliability reasons.) Invariably, each physical server would be underused.
        In contrast, server virtualization lets you run several applications—each on
        its own VM with its own OS—on a single physical computer (typically an x86 server)
        without sacrificing reliability.
        This enables maximum utilization of the physical hardware’s computing capacity. </li>
 <li> Easier management: Replacing physical computers with software-defined
     VMs makes it easier to use and manage policies written in software.
     This allows you to create automated IT service management workflows.
     For example, automated deployment and configuration tools enable administrators
     to define collections of virtual machines and applications as services, in software templates.
     This means that they can install those services repeatedly and consistently without cumbersome,
     time-consuming. and error-prone manual setup. Admins can use virtualization security policies to
     mandate certain security configurations based on the role of the virtual machine.
     Policies can even increase resource efficiency by retiring unused virtual machines to save on
     space and computing power. </li>
 <li> Minimal downtime: OS and application crashes can cause downtime and disrupt user productivity.
     Admins can run multiple redundant virtual machines alongside each other and failover between them
     when problems arise. Running multiple redundant physical servers is more expensive. </li>
 <li> Faster provisioning: Buying, installing, and configuring hardware for each application
     is time-consuming. Provided that the hardware is already in place, provisioning virtual
     machines to run all your applications is significantly faster.
     You can even automate it using management software and build it into existing workflows. </li> </ul></p>



            <p><h4> Virtualization vs. Cloud Computing- </h4>
Although equally buzz-worthy technologies, virtualization and cloud computing are not
            interchangeable. Virtualization is software that makes computing
            environments independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud
            computing is a service that delivers shared computing resources
            (software and/or data) on demand via the Internet. As complementary solutions, organizations
            can begin by virtualizing their servers and then moving to cloud computing for even
            greater agility and self-service. </p>
